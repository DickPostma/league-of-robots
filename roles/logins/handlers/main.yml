# Notes:
# * OddJob has a dependency on DBus.
# * Due to a bug systemd-logind may enter a broken state when DBus is restarted
#   making logins via SSH and or sudo commands very slow.
#   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1532105
#   Workaround for now is to always restart systemd-logind after DBus is restarted.
