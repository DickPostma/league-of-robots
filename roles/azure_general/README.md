# Azure general

## Intro

This is one of three Azure roles

 - [azure_general](../azure_general/README.md) role creates Azure group which contains the network, VMs, network interfaces and security groups. This helps with an overview of used and available Azure resources.
 - [azure_networking](../azure_networking/README.md) role defines and manages the entire network stack: networks, sub-networks and security groups within the individual Azure group.
 - [azure_computing](../azure_computing/README.md) role defines and manages the VMs, their storage, network interfaces, public IPs and private IPs inside the individual Azure group.
