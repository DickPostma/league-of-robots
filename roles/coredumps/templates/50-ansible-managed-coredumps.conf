# Disable creating coredump files: These can be huge, we never use them anyway and 
# writing relatively large files on a file system under heavy load may be so slow 
# that it causes Slurm hit the UnkillableStepTimeout limit.
# This may happen when a job exceeds its requested memory and gets killed by the Out Of Memory (OOM) Killer,
# which is perfectly normal behaviour,and writing the coredump file is so slow that it takes the node offline
# with STATE=drained and REASON="Kill task failed", which is not what we want.
