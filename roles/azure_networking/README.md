# Azure networking

## Intro

This is one of three Azure roles

 - [azure_general](../azure_general/README.md) role creates Azure group which contains the network, VMs, network interfaces, security groups. This helps with an overview of used and available Azure resources
 - [azure_networking](../azure_networking/README.md) role defines and mnages the entire stack of network: networks, sub-networks and security groups within the individual Azure group
 - [azure_computing](../azure_computing/README.md) role defines and manages the VMs, their storage, network interfaces, public IP and private IPs inside the invididual Azure group


## About internal network and public IP

The network is created with internal IPs for each VMs of the networks.
Then the public IP is assigned to those interface, together with security_groups.
Note the cidr for each public network is defined for the internal IPs and not public IPs.

## Security groups in general

Explaining security groups on the case of Azure.

The network `type` variable is needed for non-external networks, like `management`
and (not yet written) `storage` network.

When `azure.yml` playbook is deployed, it creates a
 - security group(s)
 - network and
 - subnetwork

When external: true

`group_vars/vars`
```
azure_networks:
  - name: "{{ stack_prefix }}_external"
    cidr: '10.10.1.0/24'
    external: true
    security_group: "{{ stack_prefix }}_public"
```

`static_inventory/stack`

```
azure_flavor: "Standard_DS1_v2"
host_networks:
  - name: "{{ stack_prefix }}_external"
    security_group: "{{ stack_prefix }}_external"
    assign_floating_ip: true
```

## Different security groups

 - For internal management networks, we use variables:

    ```
    azure_networks:
       name: "{{ stack_prefix }}_internal_management"
       security_group: "{{ stack_prefix }}_cluster"
       type: "management"
       cidr: 10.10.1.0/24
    ```

   make sure you define correct CIDR.

 - For Logservers security groups we must define network

    ```
    azure_networks:
       name: "{{ stack_prefix }}_external"
       security_group: "{{ stack_prefix }}_logservers"
       type: "logservers"
        cidr: 10.10.1.0/24
    ```
    Logserver are publicly available, so no CIDR needed.

## Security groups working together

Note about security groups of Azure
 - they work differently than Openstack
 - security groups can be combined, but they need to be correctly weighted in order to work
 - the weights with lower number have bigger priority
 - therefore decision was done that the following structure is used
    - 1xx are for publicly exposed ports
    - 2xx for network cidr limited port access
    - 3xx are for everything else: storage or vlans ports

## Networks and subnets

Deyployment will fail if security groups are not assigned on the
 - subnetworks
 - VMs network interfaces

## FQDN of machines

Since machine CAN get more than 1 public IP, the FQDN of that IP is created in format

`{{ stack_prefix }}-{{ inventory_hostname }}-{{ network.name | hash | first 4 letters }}.[ azure location public DNS ]`

an example for logs_library earl2 for logs_external network

`logs-earl2-6b85.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`
