On Windows you can use the built-in _**SFTP**_ or _**SCP**_ client in the corresponding tab of MobaXterm. 
Once logged in using the SSH client configuration instructions for [Windows clients](../logins-windows/), 
you can simply drag and drop from _**MobaXterm**_ to _**Windows Explorer**_ or vice versa to transfer files.
